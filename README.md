# DjangoPollsTutorialWithREST

As the name suggests, this is the Poll's app from the official django website with an added REST feature. If you are looking for a simple example using Django REST Framework, this may be useful.

The folder **mysite** contains the Django project and the **PhoneApp** is just a simple mobile app made with Cordova/PhoneGap to connect the Django REST API.


PS: Python 3.4/Django 1.8
